      <h3>What We Do</h3>
      <h2>
        Mdina Glass was set up in 1968 as Malta’s first glass making company
        using a blend of traditional glassblowing techniques and those from the
        burgeoning studio glass movements of the early-to-mid 60s.
      </h2>
      <p>
        For decades, Mdina Glass was known for primarily producing small vases,
        bowls and paperweights that appealed to tourists visiting the islands
        and to trade export clients. It was in the early 2000s that the modern
        identity of Mdina Glass took shape under the guidance of the Said
        family. This move into the home décor market saw the production team
        embark on lengthy development periods as new materials and techniques
        were employed. The results led to continuous invention. Larger, more
        colourful and expressive vases and bowls soon led to bespoke trophies,
        lighting products, lanterns, table and kitchenware, soap dispensers,
        scented candleholders, sculptures, installations, customised design
        projects and more. Since Joseph Said took over the running of Mdina
        Glass in 1985, the company has added lampwork and fusion techniques to
        its production techniques and complimented these with glass engraving.
        These techniques were never available in Malta before being introduced
        at Mdina Glass and allowed for a greater variety of products to the
        portfolio, from intricate figurines and objects to plates, dishes,
        clocks, commemorative plaques and house names. Lampwork and fusion are
        also ideal methods for producing one-off or small quantity custom-made
        orders.
